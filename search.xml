      <content type="text"><![CDATA[自博客兴起之时就想着要写个自己的博客。看着人家名人发发博文，分享生活感悟，就想把自己写的那些诗文都发到博客上，也算是个念想、无奈自己是个极懒之人，也没什么耐心，估摸着自己开个博客也无心经营，遂放弃。直到大学毕业，自己入了程序猿这个坑，才把这个念想拾起。但苦于自己没什么水平，迟迟没有动手，直到现在。为什么现在想写博客了呢？写给自己。随着自己在程序猿这条路越走越远，遇到的一些问题和解决方案，总得记录下来，即使有些问题我已经心知肚明，但是也还是想把这些积累下来，帮助自己，说不定也能帮助到别人。同时，希望自己能写个中英文的博客，就当练练英文吧。至于，能不能坚持下来呢，随心吧。 Since the rise of the blog, I wanna build a blog of mine. Why? Cause I found that celebrities write their blog to share life and sentiment, which is funny. So that I wanna post my poems and articles on the blog. But what a pretty lazy and no patience people of me, that I thought I cannot keep manamge the blog as time gone. So, abandon. Until graduated, pick up this mind when I jump down to the developer career. Cause I known I have nothing deserve to write on the blog, haven’t do it yet. But why blog now? For myself. As my job of developer, so many problems and confuse worth to mark it, even some of them had keep in my mind. I hope these can help me, maybe some one else. At the same time, I hope that I can write a blog with Chinese and English for my English practice. As for, whether it can hold on just depends on my mood. 1Console.log("Welcome to Avril's Blog.");]]></content>
